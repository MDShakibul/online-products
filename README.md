## Architecture

### Technology
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (DaisyUI)
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
- **Persistence:** localStorage

### Pages & Dataâ€‘Flow
- **Homepage(/)**
    1. Show product list.
    2. Each card expose an Add To Cart that dispatch to the Redux store.
    3. Image use <Image> for optimized delivery.
- **Product Details (/product/[id]):**
    1. Dynamic route uses server data fetching (Next.js generateStaticParams + fetch with revalidate)
    2. Show all details about a product and add a button Add To Cart.
- **Cart (/cart):**
    1. Client Component reading from Redux store, showing line items, quantity editor, remove button, and computed totals.
    2. Checkout simulation triggers a toast & store reset.
- **Success (/success):**
    2. After checkout simulation show the demo of success page.
